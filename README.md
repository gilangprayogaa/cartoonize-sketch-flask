# cartoonize-sketch-flask

# Description

It is a simple OpenCV project hosted using Flask on Heroku. It is an Flask app where frontend is done using HTML and CSS. 
In case of cartoonizing, I have used Bilateral Filtering for smoothing, Histogram equalization for equalizing the intensity levels and 
Put-text of OpenCV to put signature text on cartoonized image.
In case of sketching, I have used colour-dodge for combining two negative and positive images to produce sketch.
This project is Hosted on Heroku using Flask on https://image-cartoonizing.herokuapp.com/
